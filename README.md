# Connections Score

## Running the program
### With stdin
Run the script with `cargo run`, and paste your results into the command line. Hit enter a couple of times.


### With text files
Paste your NYT Connections results into a .txt file, and invoke the script with
```rust
cargo run -- <path_to_file>
```

You can also score multiple files by simply listing them:
```rust 
cargo run -- <path_1> <path_2> ... <path_n>
```

## Methodology
Each color has a point value based on official difficulty:
- Purple: 4
- Blue: 3
- Green: 2
- Yellow: 1

Each game is made up of guesses. Guesses closer to the start score higher.

A Connections game can have a maximum of seven rounds - 3 incorrect guesses, and 4 correct guesses.
Incorrect guesses score `0`, and correct guesses are scored as such:


We calculate a `decay factor := 49 / 7`. We choose `49` to make nice even numbers.
We take the `round factor := decay factor * (7 - round number - 1)`.
Then, we calculate `round score = color score * round factor`.
Finally, we scale by `100 / maximum score` = `100 / 420 = 0.238`.

For example, let's say we guess Green correctly on the second round. 
This means we have
- `green score := 2`
- `decay factor := 49 / 7`
- `round factor := decay factor * (7 - round number - 1) = 49 / 7 * (7 - 2 - 1) = 49 / 7 * 6 = 42`
- `round score := 2 * 42 = 84`
- `scaled := 84 * 0.238 = 20`

Using this methodology, the maximum score is for a game that looks like this:
```
游릵游릵游릵游릵 - 46.67
游릱游릱游릱游릱 - 30.00
游릴游릴游릴游릴 - 16.67
游릳游릳游릳游릳 - 6.67
Total: 100.00
```

The minimum score for a successful game looks like this:
```
游릱游릳游릵游릳 - 0.00
游릴游릱游릳游릵 - 0.00
游릴游릱游릳游릴 - 0.00
游릳游릳游릳游릳 - 6.67
游릴游릴游릴游릴 - 10.00
游릱游릱游릱游릱 - 10.00
游릵游릵游릵游릵 - 6.67
Total: 33.33
```
